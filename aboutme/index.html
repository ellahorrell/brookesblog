<h1>Ella Horrell</h1>
<p>My name is Ella Horrell, and I am an Oxford-based student currently working towards a degree in media, journalism and publishing at Oxford Brookes university. I specialise in custom digital art & illustration, as well as photography and graphic design. I am experienced in using Procreate for the majority of my projects, however I do have prior experience in most adobe programs, including (but not limited to) Photoshop, After Effects, Illustrator and Premiere Pro. I have a passion for all things art and music, and while I do play bass guitar, my strongest passion lies in writing about music.</p>
