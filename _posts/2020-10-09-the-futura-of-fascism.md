Whether we know it or not, the Futura typeface will have crossed our paths many times in our life. It is seen in popular modern brand logos like Supreme, Red Bull and Paypal, but its most common use has been within history, most notably featured on the Apollo 11 moon landing, and in 1920's Germany, Futura's birthplace.

Like its name suggests, German-born designer Paul Renner created Futura as a modern and futuristic sans-serif typeface, much different to the traditional serif styles fonts of the early 1900's. It was used abundantly by modern art pioneers at Bauhaus until its closure in 1933, prompted by the uprise in German Nazism.

Due to its links with fascist propaganda, graphic designers often warn others to steer clear from Futura. Despite this, it is still seen today to represent what it was initially created for: a vision for the future.
