Whether we know it or not, the Futura typeface will have crossed paths with us many times in our life. It is seen in popular brand logos like Supreme, Red Bull and PayPal, and commonly used in history, most notably on the Apollo 11 moon landing, and in 1920's Germany, Futura's birthplace.

Like its name suggests, German-born designer Paul Renner created Futura as a modern and futuristic sans-serif typeface, used abundantly by modern art pioneers at Bauhaus until its closure in 1933, prompted by the rise in Nazism.

Due to its links to Nazi and fascist propaganda, graphic designers often ward others to steer clear from Futura. Despite this, it has been used in popular modern art and business marketing with no issues. In present day, it still holds the same values it was created to represent: a vision for the future.
